## About this Project
This was completed as part of the IMD3002 Term Project. Our task was to procedurally generate a garden using python in Maya featuring a gazebo, fencing, flowers, vines, and grass. Each ground component was poly modelled and placed randomly within the designated ground dimensions. The vines on the gazebo use an L-system to generate various lengths. Created using Maya 2022.
